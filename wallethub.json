         "QUESTION":"Why Open a Savings Account?",
         "ANSWER":"When it comes to saving, traditional bank savings accounts are about as plain-vanilla as it gets. But for many people, vanilla is the perfect flavor. Savings accounts are one of the safest places you can put your money. That’s because bank deposit accounts are federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and credit union deposit accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). In other words, if your bank or credit union fails, you can count on getting your money back, up to a limit of $250,000 per depositor, per institution. There are a few exceptions to this rule, so if you don’t see the FDIC or NCUA logo displayed anywhere on a bank’s website or at a branch, ask about it. And if you already have $250,000 deposited at a particular bank, you’ll want to find a different bank to open a new account.<br>\n<br>\nAre there other savings vehicles that are just as safe? Sure. CDs and money market accounts are also insured bank products. U.S. treasury notes, bills, and bonds are not insured, but they are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. government, and are considered risk-free from a credit perspective.<br>\n<br>\nBut what about liquidity? Savings accounts allow you to withdraw as much of your money as you want, pretty much whenever you want, without having to wait for the account to reach maturity. This type of liquidity is critical for people who wish to use their account as an emergency fund to pay for surprise expenses, or who are preparing for a large purchase but do not know exactly when it will occur. One caveat: savings accounts are restricted to no more than six withdrawals per month. That restriction is imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, so it will not vary from institution to institution. If you go over that limit, the bank will charge a penalty. If you go over that limit repeatedly, your account could be shut down.<br>\n<br>\nSavings accounts also offer plenty of flexibility. In general, you should expect that higher interest rates will be offered for accounts with higher minimum balances, and that dipping below a minimum balance will incur a fee. That said, it’s not difficult to find a savings account with no minimum balance and no monthly fees. This flexibility makes savings accounts appropriate for a wide range of different needs, from parking large sums of cash for an indeterminate period of time to starting a nest egg with just a few dollars. A no-fee, no-minimum savings account is a popular tool for teaching children to save, because no kid wants to see bank fees chewing up his allowance. If you shop around, you’ll also be able to find savings accounts that offer ATM cards, checks, and rewards programs. And of course, online service is a given.<br>\n<br>\nThen again, not everyone wants all the frills. In an increasingly complex world, many people want to keep their finances as simple as possible. Savings accounts offer a simplicity that’s hard to find in other places. You go to a bank, you open an account, you put in your money, you let it grow—albeit at a snail’s pace, and you take it out when you need it.",

You build the fund in a savings account so that when a financial surprise crops up, you have money to cover it. Many folks live paycheck to paycheck, using all their income each month to cover their bills. When surprises occur, whether they are happy (baby, wedding, travel) or sad (job loss, breakage, illness, arrests), you've got money to cover them. If you are able, it is best to put aside some amount of money each month for emergencies until you have about 3 to 6 months of funds equal to your basic expenses. If your job is project-dependent, you'll want to have a larger emergency fund to cover the periods when you are in between jobs or if an extended weather delay prevents you from working and getting paid. Keep emergency fund money in a saving account in bank or credit union (rather than in your regular checking account where you may be more likely to use it for random or unplanned uses), and be sure to replenish it if you use it as soon as you are able. Have a great day!</p>",

If you need an account to deposit and withdraw money at will, then you’ll want to focus on regular savings accounts and <a href=\"/money-market-accounts\">money market accounts</a>. On the other hand, if you are comfortable sacrificing liquidity to earn a higher yield on interest, a <a href=\"/cd-rates\">certificate of deposit (CD)</a> might be your best bet. Our tool makes it easy to compare interest rates for all your options.<br>\n<br>\nRemember that all savings accounts limit the number of phone and computer withdrawals you can make per month. A <a href=\"/checking-accounts\">checking account</a> is a better fit for paying bills and managing monthly expenditures. Want to learn more about savings account options?
